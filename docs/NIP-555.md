# NIP-555: X-Nostr Data Mirror - Verifiable Two-Way Bridge

## Core Concept üí°

NIP-555 establishes a bidirectional verification mechanism between X (formerly Twitter) and Nostr profiles, allowing users to:

- Prove ownership across both platforms üîÑ
- Display social capital (follower counts) from X on Nostr üìä

## Verification Flow üîç

### Step 1: X ‚Üí Nostr Connection

- User can verify their Nostr identity on X in two ways:
  1. Place their Nostr public key in their X profile bio ‚úÖ
  2. Post a tweet containing their Nostr public key with the hashtag "#MyNostrKey:" ‚úÖ
- For tweets, the system will search:
  - Using Nitter to find tweets with the hashtag "#MyNostrKey:" followed by the npub
- Format: The system looks specifically for the "npub1" prefix in both bio and tweets

### Step 2: Nostr ‚Üí X Connection

- User adds their X handle to their Nostr profile with NIP-39 -- in the kind0 profile data as an extra field ‚úÖ
- Adds field: `{"x": "@username"}` in profile JSON

### Step 3: Relay Verification

- Relay detects when a user updates their kind 0 profile with an X handle
- Relay queues the verification request for asynchronous processing:
  1. Extracts the X handle from the user's kind 0 profile
  2. Adds the pubkey and X handle to a verification queue
  3. A background worker processes the queue at regular intervals
- The verification worker:
  1. Crawls the X profile without requiring official X API
  2. Verifies the Nostr public key exists in X profile bio
  3. Confirms X handle in Nostr profile matches the X account containing the public key
  4. Converts the npub found on X to hex format for exact comparison with the user's pubkey
  5. When bidirectional verification succeeds, creates a kind 555 event with verified status
  6. Imports follower count data from X and includes it in the kind 555 event
- These verifications are updated periodically to ensure freshness, for verification security and updated follower counts

## Technical Implementation

### Kind 555 Event Structure

```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "pubkey": "<relay_pubkey>",
  "created_at": 1234567890,
  "kind": 555,
  "tags": [
    ["p", "<user_pubkey>"],
    ["x", "<x_handle>"],
    ["verified", "true|false"],
    ["verification_source", "bio|tweet"],
    ["attempt", "1"],
    ["next_retry", "2023-04-02T12:34:56Z"]  // Only present for failed verifications
  ],
  "content": "{\"pubkey\":\"<user_pubkey>\",\"x_handle\":\"<x_handle>\",\"verified\":true,\"follower_count\":\"12.5K\",\"verified_at\":\"2023-04-01T12:34:56Z\",\"verification_source\":\"bio|tweet\",\"attempt_count\":1,\"next_retry_at\":\"2023-04-02T12:34:56Z\"}",
  "sig": "..."
}
```

### Verification Process

#### Relay Responsibilities

1. The relay monitors for kind 0 profile updates containing an X handle
2. When detected, the relay queues the verification request
3. A background worker processes the queue and:
   - Access the X profile using Nitter instances (more reliable than direct X access)
   - First search for npub in the user's bio
   - If not found in bio, search for tweets with the hashtag "#MyNostrKey:" to find the npub
   - Extract the follower count from the profile
   - Use Llama 3.2 Vision for screenshot analysis when direct extraction fails
4. The worker converts the npub to hex format and compares it with the user's pubkey
5. If verified, the worker creates a signed kind 555 event with the verification result
6. If verification fails, the worker:
   - Creates a kind 555 event with verified=false
   - Includes the current attempt number and next retry time (24 hours later)
   - Requeues the verification with an increased attempt counter
   - Will retry up to a configurable maximum number of attempts (default: 5)
   - Only processes requeued verifications after the 24-hour waiting period
7. The worker also periodically rescans all profiles with X handles to keep verifications up to date
8. When a user changes their X username in their kind 0 profile:
   - The system detects the change and immediately triggers a new verification
   - The verification attempt counter is reset to 0
   - Any existing pending verification for that user is removed and replaced
9. The system ensures only one kind 555 event exists per pubkey:
   - When a new kind 555 event is created, any existing ones for the same pubkey are deleted
   - This maintains a clean database and ensures clients always see the most recent verification status

#### Client Responsibilities

1. Nostr clients should:
   - Allow users to add their X handle to their kind 0 profile using the "x" field
   - Instruct users to add their npub to their X profile bio or post a tweet with "#MyNostrKey:" hashtag
   - Query the relay for kind 555 events to display verification status
   - Display verification status, follower counts, and next retry time (if applicable)
   - Provide clear UI indicators for verified, pending, and failed verifications
   - Offer guidance to users on how to fix failed verifications

2. To query verification status, clients should:
   - Request events with filter: `{"kinds": [555], "authors": [<relay_pubkey>], "#p": [<user_pubkey>]}`
   - Parse the returned kind 555 event to extract verification status and metadata
   - Display appropriate UI elements based on the verification status

3. For displaying verification status:
   - Verified: Show a checkmark or badge next to the X handle, display follower count
   - Pending: Show a pending indicator, optionally display attempt count
   - Failed: Show a failed indicator, display next retry time and guidance for fixing

### Implementation Details

- The relay uses a queue-based approach for efficient verification processing
- A dedicated worker processes verification requests asynchronously
- Nitter instance management with health tracking and automatic failover
- Smart instance selection based on success rate, response time, and priority
- Browser pooling for efficient resource usage and improved reliability
- Automatic retry mechanism with 24-hour delay between attempts
- Configurable parameters:
  - `xnostr_enabled`: Enable/disable X-Nostr verification
  - `xnostr_temp_dir`: Directory for temporary files
  - `xnostr_browser_path`: Path to the browser executable
  - `xnostr_browser_pool_size`: Maximum number of browser instances in the pool
  - `xnostr_update_interval`: How often to update verifications (in hours)
  - `xnostr_check_interval`: How often to check the queue (in seconds)
  - `xnostr_concurrency`: Number of concurrent verification processes
  - `xnostr_verification_intervals`: Configuration for verification intervals
    - `full_verification_interval_days`: How often to perform full verification
    - `follower_update_interval_days`: How often to update follower counts

    - `retry_interval_hours`: Hours to wait before retrying failed verifications (default: 24)
  - `xnostr_nitter`: Configuration for Nitter instances
    - `instances`: List of Nitter instances with priorities
    - `requests_per_minute`: Rate limit for requests
    - `failure_threshold`: Number of failures before disabling an instance
    - `recovery_threshold`: Number of successes needed to re-enable an instance
- The worker uses a semaphore pattern to limit concurrent browser instances
- Browser health checking ensures only responsive browser instances are used
- Verification results are stored as kind 555 events in the relay's database
- Failed verifications are automatically requeued with a 24-hour delay

## Comparison to NIP-05 üìù

### Similarities to NIP-05:

- Both provide social verification of user identity ‚úì
- Both rely on centralized services (domain names vs. X) ‚úì
- Both enhance trust in the Nostr network through external validation ‚úì

### Key differences:

- NIP-05 uses DNS-based verification, while NIP-555 uses social platform verification
- NIP-555 adds social capital transfer (follower counts), which NIP-05 doesn't provide
- X verification brings immediate social context from a widely-used platform

## Decentralization Considerations ‚ö†Ô∏è

Important to emphasize:

- If X disappears or blocks the verification relay, the Nostr profile remains intact üèóÔ∏è
- Your Nostr identity is not dependent on X's continued existence
- The Web of Trust (WoT) "Followed By People You Know" feature on Nostr profiles will always exist regardless of X's status
- This is a bridge to import social capital, not a dependency
- The verification is helpful but should be one of multiple trust signals, not the only one

## Future Directions üöÄ

- Expand functionality to allow importing tweets from X to Nostr
- Create the same bridge feature for GitHub accounts using GitHub bios
- Could eventually extend to YouTube and other social platforms

This NIP-555 creates a pragmatic bridge between centralized and decentralized social networks, helping users transition social capital while maintaining Nostr's core decentralization benefits.
