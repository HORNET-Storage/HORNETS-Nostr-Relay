# NIP-142: Content Filtering and Moderation System
`draft` `optional`

## Abstract
This NIP defines a comprehensive standard for content filtering and moderation in the Nostr ecosystem. It covers three main components: user-defined content filtering preferences (kind 10010), automated content moderation with tickets (kind 19841), and a dispute resolution system (kinds 19842 and 19843). Together, these components enable a more customizable, safe, and fair content experience while respecting user privacy and autonomy.

## Motivation
As the Nostr ecosystem grows, users need more control over the content they see, while relay operators need effective tools to moderate content according to their policies. Additionally, users should have the ability to dispute moderation decisions they believe are incorrect. By standardizing these systems, we enable:

1. Users to customize their feed experience by filtering out unwanted content
2. Relays to implement consistent and transparent moderation policies
3. Users to challenge moderation decisions through a standardized dispute process
4. Clients to provide consistent interfaces for these features

## Specification

### Event Types

#### Content Filtering Preferences (Kind 10010)

Content filtering preferences are expressed using events with `kind: 10010`.

##### Event Structure

```json
{
  "kind": 10010,
  "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
  "content": <filtering instructions as plain text>,
  "tags": [
    ["enabled", <"true" or "false">],
    ["mute", <comma-separated list of words to mute>]
  ],
  "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
  "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>,
  "sig": <64-bytes lowercase hex of the signature>
}
```

##### Fields

- **content**: Contains the filtering instructions as plain text. These instructions describe what content the user wants to see or filter out. The format is free-form text that can be interpreted by compatible filtering systems.

##### Tags

- **enabled**: A boolean flag indicating if filtering is enabled.
  - Format: `["enabled", "true"]` or `["enabled", "false"]`
  - Required: Yes

- **mute**: A comma-separated list of words or phrases that should be muted.
  - Format: `["mute", "word1,word2,word3"]`
  - Required: No, but recommended to include even if empty (`["mute", ""]`)

##### Privacy Model

Unlike most Nostr events which are public, kind 10010 events are treated as private to the user who created them:

1. Relays MUST NOT send kind 10010 events to any user other than the author of the event.
2. When a user requests events, relays MUST filter out kind 10010 events that were not created by that user.
3. Clients SHOULD NOT display kind 10010 events from other users, even if they are received.

##### Processing Rules

1. Relays SHOULD treat these events as replaceable (only the latest event per pubkey should be stored).
2. The filtering instructions in the `content` field SHOULD be interpreted as human-readable guidelines for content filtering.
3. The `mute` tag SHOULD be used for exact word or phrase matching, where posts containing any of the listed words would be filtered out.
4. When the `enabled` tag is set to `"false"`, clients and relays SHOULD NOT apply any filtering based on this event.

#### Moderation Ticket (Kind 19841)

Moderation tickets are created automatically when content is blocked by a relay's moderation system.

##### Event Structure

```json
{
  "kind": 19841,
  "pubkey": "<relay_pubkey>",
  "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<blocked_event_id>"],
    ["p", "<user_pubkey>"],
    ["blocked_reason", "<reason for blocking>"],
    ["content_level", "<content level>"],
    ["media_url", "<url of the media that triggered moderation>"],
    ["status", "<blocked|disputed>"]
  ],
  "content": "",
  "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>,
  "sig": <64-bytes lowercase hex of the signature>
}
```

##### Fields

- **pubkey**: The public key of the relay that created the ticket.
- **content**: Usually empty, as the relevant information is in the tags.

##### Tags

- **e**: The ID of the blocked event.
  - Format: `["e", "<blocked_event_id>"]`
  - Required: Yes

- **p**: The public key of the user who created the blocked event.
  - Format: `["p", "<user_pubkey>"]`
  - Required: Yes

- **blocked_reason**: The reason why the content was blocked.
  - Format: `["blocked_reason", "<reason>"]`
  - Required: Yes

- **content_level**: A numeric value indicating the severity of the content issue.
  - Format: `["content_level", "<level>"]`
  - Required: No

- **media_url**: The URL of the media that triggered moderation.
  - Format: `["media_url", "<url>"]`
  - Required: No

- **status**: The current status of the ticket.
  - Format: `["status", "<blocked|disputed>"]`
  - Required: Yes

##### Privacy Model

Moderation tickets (kind 19841) are only visible to:
1. The relay that created them
2. The user referenced in the "p" tag (the content creator)

Relays MUST NOT send kind 19841 events to any user other than the one referenced in the "p" tag.

##### Processing Rules

1. Only relays SHOULD create moderation tickets.
2. Tickets SHOULD be created when content is blocked by the relay's moderation system.
3. The "status" tag SHOULD be updated to "disputed" when a user creates a dispute for the ticket.
4. Tickets MAY be deleted when the associated dispute is approved.

#### Dispute (Kind 19842)

Disputes are created by users who want to challenge a moderation decision.

##### Event Structure

```json
{
  "kind": 19842,
  "pubkey": "<user_pubkey>",
  "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<ticket_event_id>"],
    ["reason", "<dispute reason>"]
  ],
  "content": "<detailed explanation of why the moderation decision was incorrect>",
  "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>,
  "sig": <64-bytes lowercase hex of the signature>
}
```

##### Fields

- **pubkey**: The public key of the user creating the dispute.
- **content**: A detailed explanation of why the user believes the moderation decision was incorrect.

##### Tags

- **e**: The ID of the moderation ticket being disputed.
  - Format: `["e", "<ticket_event_id>"]`
  - Required: Yes

- **reason**: A brief reason for the dispute.
  - Format: `["reason", "<reason>"]`
  - Required: No, but recommended

##### Free vs. Paid Dispute Model

The system implements a tiered approach to disputes:

1. **First Dispute**: Every user gets one free dispute per blocked event. This allows all users to challenge moderation decisions they believe are incorrect.
2. **Subsequent Disputes**: If a user wants to submit additional disputes for the same event (e.g., if their first dispute was rejected), they must be a paid subscriber.

This approach balances accessibility with resource management, ensuring all users have access to the dispute system while preventing abuse.

##### Privacy Model

Dispute events (kind 19842) are only visible to:
1. The user who created them
2. The relay that received them

Relays MUST NOT send kind 19842 events to any user other than the one who created them.

##### Processing Rules

1. Users can only dispute their own content.
2. A dispute MUST reference a valid moderation ticket.
3. When a dispute is received, the referenced ticket's status SHOULD be updated to "disputed".
4. For subsequent disputes of the same event, relays SHOULD verify the user's paid status.
5. Disputes SHOULD be added to a processing queue for automated or manual review.

#### Resolution (Kind 19843)

Resolutions are created by relays to respond to disputes.

##### Event Structure

```json
{
  "kind": 19843,
  "pubkey": "<relay_pubkey>",
  "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<dispute_event_id>", "dispute"],
    ["e", "<ticket_event_id>", "ticket"],
    ["e", "<original_event_id>", "original"],
    ["p", "<user_pubkey>"],
    ["resolution", "<approved|rejected>"],
    ["reason", "<reason for the decision>"]
  ],
  "content": "<detailed explanation of the resolution>",
  "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>,
  "sig": <64-bytes lowercase hex of the signature>
}
```

##### Fields

- **pubkey**: The public key of the relay that created the resolution.
- **content**: A detailed explanation of the resolution decision.

##### Tags

- **e**: References to the dispute event, ticket event, and original event.
  - Format: `["e", "<event_id>", "<role>"]`
  - Required: Yes (all three references)

- **p**: The public key of the user who created the dispute.
  - Format: `["p", "<user_pubkey>"]`
  - Required: Yes

- **resolution**: The outcome of the dispute.
  - Format: `["resolution", "<approved|rejected>"]`
  - Required: Yes

- **reason**: The reason for the decision.
  - Format: `["reason", "<reason>"]`
  - Required: No, but recommended

##### Privacy Model

Resolution events (kind 19843) are only visible to:
1. The relay that created them
2. The user referenced in the "p" tag (the dispute creator)

Relays MUST NOT send kind 19843 events to any user other than the one referenced in the "p" tag.

##### Processing Rules

1. Only relays SHOULD create resolution events.
2. When a dispute is approved, the original content SHOULD be unblocked.
3. Resolution events SHOULD be automatically deleted after 7 days to prevent database bloat.
4. The "reason" tag SHOULD provide a clear explanation of why the dispute was approved or rejected.

### Moderation Modes

Relays can implement two different moderation modes:

#### Strict Mode (Default)

In strict mode, events with media content (images, videos) are not queryable by regular users while they are pending moderation. This ensures that potentially problematic content is not visible to users until it has been properly moderated.

However, the authors of the events can still query their own events even while they are pending moderation. This allows authors to see their own content immediately after posting, providing a better user experience for content creators.

Once moderation is complete:
- Events that pass moderation become queryable by everyone
- Events that fail moderation are blocked and not queryable by anyone

#### Passive Mode

In passive mode, events with media content are queryable by everyone while they are pending moderation. This provides a more immediate user experience, as content is visible right away without waiting for moderation.

Once moderation is complete:
- Events that pass moderation remain queryable by everyone
- Events that fail moderation are blocked and not queryable by anyone

#### Implementation Guidelines

1. Relays SHOULD clearly document which moderation mode they use.
2. The moderation mode SHOULD be configurable in the relay's configuration.
3. Clients SHOULD be prepared to handle both moderation modes.
4. Relays SHOULD provide a way for users to see the status of their own content regardless of moderation mode.

### Workflows

#### Content Filtering Workflow

1. User creates a kind 10010 event with their filtering preferences
2. Relay stores the event and only sends it back to the user who created it
3. When the user requests events, the relay or client applies the filtering preferences
4. The user can update their preferences by creating a new kind 10010 event

#### Moderation Workflow

1. User submits content with media
2. Relay extracts media URLs and adds the event to the pending moderation queue
3. Based on the moderation mode:
   - Strict mode: Event is only visible to the author while pending
   - Passive mode: Event is visible to everyone while pending
4. Moderation worker processes the event:
   - If approved: Event becomes visible to everyone
   - If blocked: Event is blocked, and a moderation ticket (kind 19841) is created
5. The moderation ticket is only visible to the content creator

#### Dispute Resolution Workflow

1. User sees a moderation ticket for their blocked content
2. User creates a dispute (kind 19842) referencing the ticket
3. Relay updates the ticket status to "disputed"
4. Dispute is processed:
   - Automated: Content is re-evaluated with more lenient parameters
   - Manual: Admin reviews the dispute
5. Relay creates a resolution (kind 19843):
   - If approved: Content is unblocked
   - If rejected: Content remains blocked
6. If the user wants to submit another dispute for the same content:
   - If they are a paid subscriber: Allowed
   - If not a paid subscriber: Rejected

## Privacy Considerations

### Content Filtering Privacy

Content filtering preferences are private events on the Nostr network, which means they should only be visible to the user who created them. This is enforced by relay implementations that:

1. Only send kind 10010 events to the user who authored them
2. Filter out kind 10010 events from other users when responding to queries
3. Ensure that a user's filtering preferences are not visible to other users

### Moderation Privacy

Moderation events (kinds 19841, 19842, 19843) are also private and should only be visible to the relevant parties:

1. Moderation tickets (kind 19841) are only visible to the content creator
2. Disputes (kind 19842) are only visible to the dispute creator
3. Resolutions (kind 19843) are only visible to the dispute creator

This privacy model ensures that moderation actions are transparent to the affected users while maintaining privacy for everyone else.

## Client Behavior

Clients that support this NIP SHOULD:

### For Content Filtering

1. Provide a user interface for creating and editing content filtering preferences
2. Apply filtering based on the user's preferences when displaying content
3. Clearly indicate when content is being filtered and provide options to view filtered content
4. Never display kind 10010 events from other users, even if they are received

### For Moderation

1. Display moderation tickets to the content creator
2. Provide a user interface for creating disputes
3. Display resolution events to the dispute creator
4. Clearly indicate the status of moderated content
5. Never display moderation events from other users, even if they are received

## Relay Behavior

Relays that support this NIP SHOULD:

### For Content Filtering

1. Store kind 10010 events as replaceable events
2. Only send kind 10010 events to the user who authored them
3. Filter out kind 10010 events from other users when responding to queries
4. Optionally filter events sent to users based on their filtering preferences

### For Moderation

1. Implement a moderation system with either strict or passive mode
2. Create moderation tickets when content is blocked
3. Process disputes through automated or manual review
4. Create resolution events when disputes are resolved
5. Only send moderation events to the relevant users
6. Automatically delete resolution events after 7 days

}
```

## Compatibility

This NIP is compatible with all existing Nostr clients and relays. Clients and relays that do not support this NIP will simply ignore the event kinds defined here (10010, 19841, 19842, 19843).

Relays that implement this NIP should ensure backward compatibility by:

1. Not requiring clients to understand these event kinds
2. Continuing to support existing moderation mechanisms
3. Gracefully handling clients that do not support these event kinds

Clients that implement this NIP should ensure backward compatibility by:

1. Not requiring relays to support these event kinds
2. Gracefully handling relays that do not support these event kinds
3. Providing fallback mechanisms for users on relays that do not support these event kinds
