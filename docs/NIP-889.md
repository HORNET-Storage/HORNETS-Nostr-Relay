# NIP-889: Private Content Filtering Preferences
`draft` `optional`

## Abstract
This NIP defines a standard for users to express their content filtering preferences using kind 10010 events. These preferences allow compatible relays and clients to filter content based on user-defined instructions and muted words, while ensuring that these preferences remain private to the user who created them.

## Motivation
Users often want to customize their feed experience by filtering out content they're not interested in or find objectionable. By standardizing how these preferences are expressed, relays and clients can implement consistent filtering mechanisms that respect user choices while maintaining privacy.

## Specification

### Event Structure
Content filtering preferences are expressed using events with `kind: 10010`.

```json
{
  "kind": 10010,
  "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
  "content": <filtering instructions as plain text>,
  "tags": [
    ["enabled", <"true" or "false">],
    ["mute", <comma-separated list of words to mute>]
  ],
  "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
  "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>,
  "sig": <64-bytes lowercase hex of the signature>
}
```

### Fields

- **content**: Contains the filtering instructions as plain text. These instructions describe what content the user wants to see or filter out. The format is free-form text that can be interpreted by compatible filtering systems.

### Tags

- **enabled**: A boolean flag indicating if filtering is enabled.
  - Format: `["enabled", "true"]` or `["enabled", "false"]`
  - Required: Yes

- **mute**: A comma-separated list of words or phrases that should be muted.
  - Format: `["mute", "word1,word2,word3"]`
  - Required: No, but recommended to include even if empty (`["mute", ""]`)

### Privacy Model

Unlike most Nostr events which are public, kind 10010 events are treated as private to the user who created them:

1. Relays MUST NOT send kind 10010 events to any user other than the author of the event.
2. When a user requests events, relays MUST filter out kind 10010 events that were not created by that user.
3. Clients SHOULD NOT display kind 10010 events from other users, even if they are received.

This privacy model ensures that a user's filtering preferences remain confidential and are only used to filter content for that specific user.

### Processing Rules

1. Relays SHOULD treat these events as replaceable (only the latest event per pubkey should be stored).
2. The filtering instructions in the `content` field SHOULD be interpreted as human-readable guidelines for content filtering.
3. The `mute` tag SHOULD be used for exact word or phrase matching, where posts containing any of the listed words would be filtered out.
4. When the `enabled` tag is set to `"false"`, clients and relays SHOULD NOT apply any filtering based on this event.

### Implementation Approaches

Implementations may use different approaches to apply these filtering preferences:

1. **Client-side filtering**: Clients can filter received events based on the user's preferences.
2. **Relay-side filtering**: Relays that support this NIP can filter events before sending them to users.
3. **AI-assisted filtering**: The instructions in the `content` field can be used with language models to determine if content matches the user's preferences.

## Examples

### Basic Filtering Instructions

```json
{
  "kind": 10010,
  "created_at": 1715027400,
  "content": "I want to filter my Nostr feed based on these preferences:\nRule 1: Include content about technology and programming.\nRule 2: Filter out political content.\nRule 3: Include thoughtful discussions, even if controversial.",
  "tags": [
    ["enabled", "true"],
    ["mute", "spam,scam,airdrop"]
  ],
  "pubkey": "32-bytes-hex",
  "id": "32-bytes-hex",
  "sig": "64-bytes-hex"
}
```

### Disabled Filtering

```json
{
  "kind": 10010,
  "created_at": 1715027400,
  "content": "I want to filter my Nostr feed based on these preferences:\nRule 1: Include content about technology and programming.\nRule 2: Filter out political content.",
  "tags": [
    ["enabled", "false"],
    ["mute", ""]
  ],
  "pubkey": "32-bytes-hex",
  "id": "32-bytes-hex",
  "sig": "64-bytes-hex"
}
```

## Privacy Considerations

Content filtering preferences are private events on the Nostr network, which means they should only be visible to the user who created them. This is enforced by relay implementations that:

1. Only send kind 10010 events to the user who authored them
2. Filter out kind 10010 events from other users when responding to queries
3. Ensure that a user's filtering preferences are not visible to other users

This privacy model differs from most Nostr events, which are typically public. The private nature of kind 10010 events ensures that users can express their content preferences without revealing potentially sensitive information about their interests or sensitivities.

## Client Behavior

Clients that support this NIP SHOULD:

1. Provide a user interface for creating and editing content filtering preferences
2. Apply filtering based on the user's preferences when displaying content
3. Clearly indicate when content is being filtered and provide options to view filtered content
4. Never display kind 10010 events from other users, even if they are received

## Relay Behavior

Relays that support this NIP MUST:

1. Store kind 10010 events as replaceable events
2. Only send kind 10010 events to the user who authored them
3. Filter out kind 10010 events from other users when responding to queries

Relays MAY:

1. Filter events sent to users based on their filtering preferences
2. Indicate to clients when filtering has been applied

## Compatibility

This NIP is compatible with all existing Nostr clients and relays. Clients and relays that do not support this NIP will simply ignore kind 10010 events.
