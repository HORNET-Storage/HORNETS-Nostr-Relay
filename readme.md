# H.O.R.N.E.T Storage: Multimedia Nostr Relay
H.O.R.N.E.T.S stands for **Hash Organized Relay Network Enabling Tamper-resistant Storage**. The Multimedia Nostr Relay supports chunked file storage with Scionic Merkle Trees and is equipped with Libp2p to sync with other Multimedia Nostr Relays, free of centralized certificate authories.

### bbolt: Stateful Buckets
bbolt provides support for bucketing, meaning content can be organized in an incredibly organized way. Bucketing is like a library. üìö First, the librarian traverses the name of each book title (name of each bucket/database instance), then moves on to the pages (key-value pairs in that bucket) within the book. This traversal method is a lot quicker than skimming through every page in the library to find something specific. Nested databases (buckets) allow for this type of hierarchical data organization, so far more databases can be accessed concurrently, meaning traversal speeds may be faster even if bbolt doesn‚Äôt match-up to the raw speed of LMDB.

### Libp2p: Transport and Networking
H.O.R.N.E.T Storage utilizes libp2p for its transport layers and networking, eliminating dependence on the centralized web. This forms the basis for the Hornet browser extension, similar to the [IPFS companion](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-companion) browser extension.

### Toggling Nostr Apps/Services
Data is tagged with a unique identifier indicating its type of application, such as "nostr note" for posts, "nostrtube" for a nostr YouTube video, "stemstr" for a stemstr music note, "git" for a git repository¬†folder, et al. The web-based relay manager will allow relay operators to view data usage per application over periods of time, and it will also allow¬†them to toggle which file types they want to host.

## Disclaimer
‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: The Hornet relay is currently in its development phase. It is not yet stable and is not recommended for production use. Users are advised to exercise caution. More comprehensive information will be provided soon.
